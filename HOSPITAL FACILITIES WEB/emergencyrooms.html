    <p>Emergency rooms (ERs) are dedicated medical facilities that provide immediate care for patients experiencing critical or life-threatening conditions. Operating 24/7, ERs are staffed by highly trained physicians, nurses, and specialists equipped to handle a wide range of emergencies, from severe injuries and heart attacks to strokes and respiratory issues. Advanced diagnostic tools, imaging technology, and life-saving equipment ensure rapid assessment and treatment. ER teams prioritize patients based on the severity of their condition, ensuring urgent cases receive prompt attention. The goal of emergency rooms is to stabilize patients, prevent further complications, and facilitate their path to recovery or hospitalization.</p>
